      <h1>Maya Beliefs</h1>
      <p>The first fully formed men to be created were known as the "Wizard of the Fatal Laugh", the "Wizard of the Night", the "Careless", and the "Black Wizard". They were gifted with intelligence and had knowledge of everything in the world.</p>
      <p>With their keen eyesight, they saw all that was around them and constantly marveled at the sky's arch and the earth's round face.</p>
      <p>But their creator spoke, asking, "Now that they know everything, what shall we do with them? Let us limit their sight, so that they may only see a small part of the earth's face. They are but simple creatures, made by our hands. Must they also be gods?"</p>
