      <h1>Maya People</h1>
      <p>The Ancient Maya were a sophisticated culture that established their cities in the rainforest and were famous for their knowledge of the stars. They were fascinated by the idea of time and developed advanced astronomy, calendar systems, and writing. The Maya chewed gum, filed their teeth, and raised bees without stingers. They built elaborate pyramids, often adorned with murals and intricate architectural details, which are similar to the pyramids built by the Egyptians.</p>
      <p>The Maya were the most advanced of all ancient Mesoamerican cultures and originated in Yucat√°n in Mexico, the area around what is now the resort beach city of Cancun. They were highly skilled potters and weavers and built their structures without metal tools. Despite their advanced civilization, the centers of Maya culture began to decline around AD 900 for reasons that are still unknown. Some of these centers continued until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.</p>
