      <h1>Maya Civilization</h1>
      <p>Like the Egyptians, the Mayas are well known for pyramids, which vary in shape depending on where they were built. The Mayas occupied the Yucatán peninsula of Mexico.</p>
      <p>The civilization was formed as early as 1500 BC.</p>
      <p>The Mayan religion centered around the worship of many nature gods. Their amazing architecture remain as great ruins at centers they used for religious ceremonies, including Palenque, Uxmal, Copán, Tikal and Chichén Itzá.</p>
      <p>They developed astronomy, calendar systems and writing. They built observatories to watch stars. They were highly skilled as potters and weavers.</p>
      <p>About AD 300 to 900, the major centers including Palenque, Tikal, and Copán were mysteriously abandoned. The reasons are still unknown. A few centers continued until the Spanish arrived in the 16th century.</p>
