        <p>
          Today, the Maya homeland is being studied by archaeologists who unearth buildings to reconstruct local cultures. They date and compare artifacts to determine where the Maya traded and what their daily lives were like, and they work with botanists who study ancient pollen to detect changes in the climate and environment, and art historians who examine art and architecture.

          Epigraphers decipher hieroglyphs to recover the history and stories of the Maya. Just 30 years ago, a team of scientists figured out that the Maya clearly used complex sentence structure, whereas before that, scientists thought the glyphs (the pictures that stand for words) were just lists of dates and heroic feats. The Maya wrote stories that utilized plays on words and other language techniques.

          Led by expert scientists, hundreds of students continue to solve the mysteries by working in thatched huts and under the direction of Maya archaeologists.
